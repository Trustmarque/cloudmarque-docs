## Why DevOps?
The Cloudmarque Operating Guide describes a DevOps-oriented approach to managing a cloud estate with the following characteristics:

   1. ### Streamlined Teams
      A unified team combining both Development and Operations, (or _change_ and _run_ resources) enable smooth rollout of new systems. Teams are typically defined by "product", or "value stream" and have work arranged by a Product Owner. All the skills required to change and run a product are nurtured within the team, preserving expertise and encouraging learning.

   2. ### Continuous Improvement
      Faster innovation through cyclical delivery with the right expertise

   3. ### Reduced waste
      Dev/Run transition is cleaner and fast feedback, effective team prioritisation.
