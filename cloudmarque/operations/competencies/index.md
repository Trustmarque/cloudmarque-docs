## What are competencies?
Competencies describe specific configurations of culture, process, and technology required to achieve a desired delivery capability. These are represented as a DevOps cycle, where new capability is developed (blue), and where its operational health is maintained (purple).

The "infinite loop" diagram describes the differing skills required to support a work item as it passes through the delivery lifecycle.

Successful delivery of work items relies on a range of capabilities at different points in the delivery cycle. This cycle does not align to Agile [ceremony](/cloudmarque/operations/ceremony/), which describes delivery team cadence, as work items may be at different stages of delivery and involve different competencies during an Agile iteration.
