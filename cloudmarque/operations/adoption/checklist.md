title: Adoption checklist
summary: Looking for a planning cheat-sheet for cloud adoption? Here's a generic list of decisions and tasks to get you started.
---
The checklist is provided in four sections, each representing a different step in a phased adoption plan.

## Phase One - Envision
Build a clear picture of your future operating model, socialise your vision, and start to make tooling decisions.

  - [x] Identify your target DevOps team structure
  - [x] Identify any transitional DevOps team structure (if required)
  - [x] Acquire access to cloud services
     - [x] Ensure your procurement teams are ready for consumption-based billing
     - [x] Agree budgets and budget holders
     - [x] Decide your environment segregation strategy and set up the requisite accounts/subscriptions
  - [x] Create a shortlist of required [information systems](/cloudmarque/operations/adoption/systems.html) 
     - [x] Create a shortlist of work management tools
     - [x] Create a shortlist of CI/CD tools and platforms
     - [x] Create a shortlist of knowledge sharing tools

## Phase Two - Build 
Start making changes! Ideally, begin with a few people and make them responsible for completing setup tasks, owning relevant ceremony diary meetings, and configuring their own tooling.

  - [x] Recruit or second people into your target teams
  - [x] Select a work management tool for your DevOps Team
  - [x] Select and configure a Knowlegebase for knowledge sharing between your Engineering Team and Service Desk
  - [x] Set up your CI/CD tooling
  - [x] Deploy Cloudmarque's Core Building Block
  - [x] Connect your cloud monitoring capability/alerts to your Service Desk
  - [x] Populate a backlog
  - _Using an iterative planning methodology?_
     - [x] Decide on an iteration length (typically 1, 2, or 3 weeks)

## Phase Three - Launch
Initiate an iterative delivery cycle and work through all the processes, validating and finalising any setup activities.

  - [x] Ensure both your Service Desk and DevOps Team have access to the 
  Knowlegebase
  - [x] Complete your first iteration including all ceremonies
  - [x] Use CI/CD to automate cloud deployments

## Phase Four - Nurture
Like all Agile teams, your new DevOps capability should be self-organising and self-improving. However, there is much that leadership can do to encourage improvement and ensure the team does not stagnate.

 - [x] Reiterate the ownership that a team has to change and improve their working practises, ensuring they realise that they are empowered to change
 - [x] Communicate wider business plans to ensure team members are correctly prioritising and investing in automation where applicable
 - [x] Celebrate wins!
 - [x] Ensure that the team is pacing themselves: iterative delivery is a continuous practise and members may experience "burnout" if subjected to continual high-pressure deadlines. View progress as a marathon, rather than a sprint.
 - [x] Identify new tools, delivery platforms, and system features which may accelerate delivery
 - [x] Ensure that learning is documented and that retrospective feedback is acted upon
