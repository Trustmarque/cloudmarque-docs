title: Deploying via Azure Pipelines
summary: Automate deployments from source code repositories using Cloudmarque PowerShell Tools for Azure and Azure Pipelines.
---
This guide describes how to use Cloudmarque tooling in a more controlled context, with automated rather than manual deployments. We recommend this approach for production environments as it provides consistent repeatable quality with clear troubleshooting and issue remediation processes.

Ideally, environments should be deployed sequentially to an isolated production-like test environment prior to deployment to Prodution. Some workloads are unable to support this approach, and you should [tailor your environment strategy](/cloudmarque/architecture/devops/environments.html) according the constraints of your workload and organisation.
