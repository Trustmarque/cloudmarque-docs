title: Images
summary: Cloudmarque icons can be used to visualise an architecture using diagrams to depict different aspects of an overall solution.
---
Two icon sets are available for use in custom documentation: one set for use on a light background and one for use on darker backgrounds. To download an icon, right-click on it and choose "Save image as..." (or similar). Note that these are SVG images.

## Icons
Full-colour icons found at the repository location `/assets/images/cloudmarque/icons` in the folders `light` and `dark` (referring to background) are listed below. Every icon should have both a light and dark counterpart.

{% include icon-color-list.html type="icons" darkPath="images/cloudmarque/icons/dark" lightPath="images/cloudmarque/icons/light" %}

## Symbols
Symbols are found at the repository location `/assets/images/cloudmarque/symbols`. These are monochrome shapes that can be recoloured in an application like PowerPoint to create new diagrams.

{% include icon-list.html type="symbols" path="images/cloudmarque/symbols" dark=true %}
